    <p class="home-paragraph">I first came across Founders & Coders last summer and was thrilled
      to discover the programme’s unique approach. After switching to a part-time position recently,
      I dedicated the past four months to completing the course prerequisites and I am excited to
      finally submit my application for the Summer 2019 Cohort.</p>

  <div class="home-block">
    <h1 class="home-title">Experience so far</h1>
    <p class="home-paragraph">For the past five years, I have been Digital Manager at NVS, 
      a record label and music company organising three music festivals - Outlook, Dimensions 
      and We Out Here. In this role, I oversee all aspects of the company’s digital output, 
      commission and edit content and use social media to reach musical communities around Europe. 
      I also run programmatic advertising campaigns and work closely with our web developer to 
      update the company’s websites.</br></br>
      After a Bachelor’s in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, I completed a Master’s in London 
      and wrote a dissertation on the changing models of independent record labels in the digital economy, 
      before pursuing work in the music industry.</br></br>
      I have thoroughly enjoyed working in this creative environment and have felt privileged to 
      collaborate with dedicated colleagues and talented artists, but, for a while now, I have been 
      thinking about changing paths to broaden my horizons and work on socially-driven projects with 
      collaboration at their heart.

  <div class="home-block">
    <h1 class="home-title">Learning how to code</h1>
    <p class="home-paragraph"> I was intrigued by coding for a while before getting started. I was eager to better 
      understand the platforms which, for better or worse, play such an important role in shaping our everyday life 
      through our phones, tablets and laptops. I met with programmers to learn more about their job and discovered 
      some of them worked on impact-led initiatives related to social mobility, investigative journalism and 
      other social enterprises.</br></br>
      Last summer, I started using Founders & Coders’ prerequisites as a learning template before attending 
      an information meeting and coding meet-ups in the autumn. The programme’s people, ethos and learning 
      approach made me feel motivated and convinced me that it would be the ideal community to become a 
      fully-fledged developer.
    </p>

  <div class="home-block">
    <h1 class="home-title">Joining Founders & Coders</h1>
    <p class="home-paragraph">Peer-to-peer learning happened organically in my digital marketing job. I trained and 
      managed new starters in the digital team, shared digital insights with the wider team weekly, and became versed 
      in graphic design and video editing thanks to the time and goodwill of my co-workers. This collaborative learning 
      approach seems particularly suited to coding, where each individual confronted with the same problem is likely to 
      come up with its own particular solution.</br></br>
      Founders & Coders’ commitment to supporting impactful initiatives through the Tech For Better programme is also 
      inspiring and something I would love to be a part of. After completing the programme, I would be pleased to give 
      back to the community – and put my new knowledge to the test – by mentoring new students and prospective applicants.

    <h1 class="home-title">Course prerequisites</h1>
    <p class="home-paragraph">As per the course prerequisites I have earned over 250 points on 
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/victormasson21" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>, completed the 
      main recommended sections, and reached 5kyu and over 300 points on 
      <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/Rev8617" target="_blank">Codewars</a>. The carousel is hosted on the 
      <a href="slider.html" target="_blank">slider page</a> of this site. 
      I will be in London on the week of May 13th, I would love the opportunity to discuss my application
      in person and hope to hear from you soon!
